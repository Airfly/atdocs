# Configure an Android Things Product


The **PRODUCT SETTINGS** tab in the [Android Things Console](https://partner.android.com/things/console) allows you to change the product settings.

To configure your product:

1.  If you are not already on this tab, open the [Android Things Console](https://partner.android.com/things/console) and click a product you previously [created](https://developer.android.google.cn/things/console/create.html). The **Product settings** box appears.
