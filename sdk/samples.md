# Samples


<p>Welcome to code samples for Android Things. Here you will find code snippets and
tutorials to help you build embedded applications and integrate hardware
peripherals. You can get started with the following samples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-simplepio"><strong>Simple PIO</strong></a> -
    Runs basic code that exercises the PIO APIs in Java. Each sample is an
    Android module that can be run independently.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-nativepio"><strong>Native PIO</strong></a> -
    Runs basic code that exercises the PIO APIs in C/C++. Each sample is an
    Android module that can be run independently.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-simpleui"><strong>Simple UI</strong></a> -
    Basic user interface that represents each GPIO on the board by an interactive
    switch widget on the display.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-button"><strong>Button</strong></a> -
    Using a button input driver from the peripheral driver library to listen for
    GPIO state changes and generate Android key events.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-uartloopback"><strong>UART Loopback</strong></a> -
    Emulates a loopback adapter for the selected UART port. Echoes all data
    back out the same port.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/doorbell"><strong>Doorbell</strong></a> -
    Smart doorbell that captures a camera image, analyzes it, and sends it to a
    companion app using the Google Cloud Platform and Firebase.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/weatherstation"><strong>Weather Station</strong></a> -
    Integration of multiple peripheral sensors to analyze and display current
    weather information. Data can optionally push to the Google Cloud Platform
    for further analysis.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-tensorflow-imageclassifier"><strong>TensorFlow</strong></a> -
    Demonstrates accessing the camera, performing object recognition and image
    classification using machine learning, and speaking out the results using
    text-to-speech (TTS).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-bluetooth-audio"><strong>Bluetooth Audio</strong></a> -
    Enables a Bluetooth device to connect to a peer device and play audio
    on it (and vice-versa).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-bluetooth-le-gattserver"><strong>Bluetooth GATT Server</strong></a> -
    Exposes time information to client Bluetooth devices. The Android client
    receives a notification when the time is changed on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-usbenum"><strong>USB Enumerator</strong></a> -
    Iterates over all the USB devices discovered by the host and prints their
    interfaces and endpoints.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/edison-candle"><strong>Edison Candle</strong></a> -
    Uses an animation API to flicker a pair of LEDs to mimic the behavior of a
    candle. Includes hardware design files and a bill of materials to assist in
    building a production device.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sensorhub-cloud-iot"><strong>Cloud IoT Sensor Hub</strong></a> -
    Integration of a motion detector and weather-related peripheral sensors. Data
    is pushed to the Google Cloud Platform for low-latency messaging.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-googleassistant"><strong>Google Assistant API</strong></a> -
    Demonstrates how to call the Google Assistant gRPC API from a device. Records
    the spoken request from a connected microphone and plays back the Assistant's
    spoken response on a connected speaker.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/androidthings/drivers-samples"><strong>Drivers</strong></a> -
    Sample peripheral drivers for Android Things. Includes drivers for an OLED
    screen, GPS, accelerometer, and more.</li>
</ul>
