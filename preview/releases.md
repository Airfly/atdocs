*   Google Play Services requires 2-3 minutes on first boot to pre-optimize dex. App installs are blocked until this process is complete.
*   When multiple activities contain an intent filter for the `IOT_LAUNCHER` category, the system displays an app chooser that isn't accessible on devices without display support. Android Things only supports a single launcher app, and this behavior will be disabled in a future release.

#### Peripheral I/O

*   Peripherals do not clear or reset after calling `close()`. Outputs will retain their state and serial ports may continue to transmit previously buffered data.
*   GPIO pins cannot be used as an output if they were previously enabled as an input with an edge trigger enabled since the last reboot.

#### User Drivers

*   User sensors cannot currently be unregistered manually. They are unregistered automatically when the app process terminates.
*   User sensors only support [continuous and on-change](https://source.android.google.cn/devices/sensors/report-modes.html) sensors. One-shot and special reporting modes may not function as expected.

#### Edison

*   **Audio:** Recording is not currently supported.
*   **I/O:** GPIO pin **GP77** is listed by `PeripheralManagerService`, but is not accessible to apps.
*   **RESET:** The RESET button on the Arduino breakout board can temporarily leave your board in an inconsistent state where GPIO pins are named GPXX instead of IOXX until power is disconnected. Instead of using the onboard RESET button, disconnect and reconnect power to reboot.

#### Pico

*   **Network:** Ethernet is currently disabled.
*   **I/O:** `Gpio.getValue()` always returns `false` when the pin is configured as an output.

#### Raspberry Pi

*   **Network:** Wi-Fi cannot connect to the internet if Ethernet is also connected to a network without internet access.
*   **Graphics:** Hardware graphics acceleration is not currently enabled.
*   **Camera:** A new `CameraCaptureSession` cannot be created with more than one target output surface.
*   **Camera:** The first request in any `CameraCaptureSession` always queues two images. This can cause each subsequent `CaptureRequest` in the same session to return a buffered frame from a previous capture.
*   **I/O:** Shared pins **BCM13/PWM1** and **BCM18/PWM0** cannot be used for GPIO if they were previously enabled for PWM since the last reboot.
*   **I/O:** GPIO pins **BCM23** and **BCM24** are both currently mapped to control **BCM23** (physical pin J8-16).
*   **I/O:** GPIO pins **BCM4**, **BCM5**, and **BCM6** are internally pulled up to 3.3V when used as inputs.
