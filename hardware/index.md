# Bringing Device Production to Everyone

Android Things lets you build professional, mass-market products on a trusted platform, without previous knowledge of embedded system design.
## Turnkey Hardware Solutions

We work with SoC partners to build Android Things certified development boards that contain SoMs (System-on-Modules) to get you developing fast.
#### Integrated Parts

SoMs integrate the SoC, RAM, Flash Storage, WiFi, Bluetooth and other components onto a single board and come with all of the necessary FCC certifications. You can optimize your board design by flattening existing modules onto a PCB to save costs and space.
#### Google BSP

The Board Support Package (BSP) is managed by Google. This gives you a trusted platform to develop on with standard updates and fixes from Google.
#### Differentiated hardware

Our partners provide development boards with different SoMs and form factors to suit your needs, giving you choice and flexibility.
See [Developer Kits](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/developer-kits.html) for a list of supported development boards and starter kits.
## Low Barrier to Entry

Take advantage of Google's platform and support to scale from prototypes to complete products quickly.
#### Get started quickly

Building devices is now within reach for everyone, even if you've never designed embedded systems. We provide a turnkey hardware solution and an easy-to-use software development platform, based on Android Studio and the Android SDK.
#### Managed costs

Android Things reduces the large upfront development costs and risks inherent in getting your idea off the ground. When you're ready to ship large quantities of devices, your costs scale linearly. In addition, ongoing engineering and testing costs are reduced by Google-provided updates.
