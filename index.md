# The ease and power of Android
# 如 Android 一样，简单而不失强大

If you can build an app, you can build a device

你只要能开发 Android 应用，就同样可以构建智能设备


#### The Android ecosystem
#### Android 开发技术生态系统支撑

Leverage existing Android development tools, APIs, resources, and a thriving developer community.

完善的 Android 开发工具、应用程序接口、资源，以及不断发展的开发者社区，助你的开发事半功倍。

#### New APIs for IoT devices
#### 为物联网设备新增的应用程序接口

Develop with new Android framework APIs that provide low level I/O and libraries for common components like temperature sensors, display controllers, and more.

新的 Android 框架为你提供了常用组件的底层输入输出接口和开发库，比如温度传感器、显示控制器等。

#### Trusted security

Take advantage of regular best-in-class security updates by building on top of the Android OS.

# Rapid prototypes to real products

#### Build products at scale

Shipping products is easy because our prototype boards are commercial grade. The same boards can be easily customized by your prototype supplier to fit your specific form-factor and other needs, all while running the same software.

To learn more about the hardware program, see our [Hardware Platform Overview](https://developer.android.google.cn/things/hardware/index.html).
